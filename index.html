                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Gosh&#44; this is my longest streak in coding so far&#46; I honestly started learning in 2017 but I have been on a long hiatus because I prioritized the wrong things in life&#46; Jeez&#33; I guess that's the most wonderful thing about being an adult. Sometimes, going down the wrong lane teaches you to be good at taking the right directions.</p>
                    <p>Just a couple of days ago&#44; I was so frustrated while documenting my coding progress in twitter because I felt so unproductive&#46; But one thing I put in mind when I started doing this again is that &lsquo;<em>Persistence</em> is always the <strong>key</strong>&rsquo;&#46; So&#44; I told myself I	&#39;m not going to quit just because I	&#39;m frustrated&#46; It can be challenging but worth it&#46;It feels so good to be back on track. This is the start of my journey into web development. <br>Here's one quote I found on the web that may help motivate you if you're also a beginner like me. <strong>Just keep going.</strong>  <br> Oh and by the way, for the meantime, <strong>stay home</strong> and don't forget to <strong>frequently wash your hands.</strong></p>
