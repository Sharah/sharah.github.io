                <p>Hi&#44; My name is <strong>Sharah</strong>&#46;<br>
                     I am an aspiring web developer from the Philippines&#46;</p>
                <p>I am happily employed full&#45;time but I am learning how to code just to expand  my skill set&#46; In the photo above is my pet, Patrick. <br>So many good things happened since I adopted him. I learned to become more responsible than I thought I already was. He also taught me a lot of patience. Why am I sharing you all this? Because this is why I'm coding again. I learned I'm the one responsible for my growth and that there is no such thing as <em>something for nothing</em>. I have always wanted to learn how to code but <strong>Procrastination</strong> always got in the way. <br>As I learned to be more patient of myself, I also developed the persistence mindset. Because the thing is, no matter how small of a progress I make as long as there's effort in trying, I will keep on trying. Drama. <strong>LOL</strong></p>
